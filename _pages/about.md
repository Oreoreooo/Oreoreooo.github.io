Hi! This is Bao Xinyang. I am current a MSc student in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at HKU, supervised by [Professor Yulin SHAO](https://www.eee.hku.hk/people/ylshao/). I am passionate about exploring creative and practical applications of AI, turning innovative ideas into interactive and impactful technologies.

In addition to my studies, I work as a part-time teaching assistant at [HKU Innovation Wing](https://innowings.engg.hku.hk/innowing1/), where I help members in using 3D printers and laser cutting machines and supporting hands-on prototyping and rapid fabrication. I enjoy bridging the gap between research and real-world applications, building projects that are both fun and functional.
